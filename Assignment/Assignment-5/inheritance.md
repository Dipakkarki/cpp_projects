# Inheritance
]In C++, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

* derived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class
* base class (parent) - the class being inherited from
To inherit from a class, use the ":" symbol.

# Two types of Inheritance :
* multilevel inheritance:
=> A class can also be derived from one class, which is already derived from another class.

In the following example, MyGrandChild is derived from class MyChild (which is derived from MyClass).

* multiple Inheritance:
=> A class can also be derived from more than one base class, using a comma-separated list:


* Objective: To familiarize students with inheritance concepts.
* Theory:
* Inheritance: Process of creating new class from one or more existing class, the properties of existing 
class is extended to new class, the new class is called derived class and existing class is called base class
* Types of Inheritance:
• Single • Multiple • Multi-level
• Hierarchical • Hybrid • Multipath
* Ambiguity: In OOP ambiguity means duplication of members due to inheritance, In child class there will 
be 2 or more member with same name from inherited class.
Virtual Base Class: To avoid ambiguity we can make the common base class as virtual base class
Container Class: Class consists of object of one class in another objec
